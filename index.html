It’s like the digital doorway to all things electric in Gujranwala. If you’re not sure about the URL, just remember, “GEP” as in “Get Every Power” (well, almost).</li>
                <li><strong>Locate the Bill Inquiry Section</strong><br>Once you’re on the GEPCO homepage, look for the section labeled “Bill Inquiry” or “Online Bill Check.” This is typically found in the main menu or under the services tab.

                <li><strong>Enter Your Details</strong><br>You’ll need to enter a few details to proceed. This usually includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Customer ID</strong>: This is a unique number associated with your account. It’s like your account’s social security number but less dramatic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reference Number</strong>: This is found on your previous electricity bills. If you don’t have it handy, don’t worry—just find an old bill and take a look.</li>
